# YNADK: You Need A Drum Kit

A web-project for creating soundfonts, audio kits and drum kits easily, aimed
for the M8 Tracker.

Available at https://miomoto.de/ynadk

## Background

The M8 Tracker has support for cue points in wav, allowing for assembling
drum kits in sliced wav files.

## How to use

- drop some files into the browser window
- assign some wav files to a slot in the center
- click on render
- place the resulting wav file on the tracker
- create a new instrument on the tracker
- load the file
- set the slicing to `01 file`

Done! You can now play back the samples you've compiled by playing the
corresponding note on the key bed.
